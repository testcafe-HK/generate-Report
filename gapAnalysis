1. Define Objectives and Scope
Identify the goals of your test automation strategy (e.g., increase coverage, reduce manual effort, improve test efficiency).
Define the scope of the analysis (functional, non-functional, regression, performance, etc.).
2. Identify Current State
Document existing test automation coverage (test cases, scripts, frameworks, tools).
Assess the percentage of test cases automated vs. manual.
Evaluate execution frequency, reliability, and maintainability of automated scripts.
3. Define the Desired State
Establish the expected level of automation coverage.
Set benchmarks based on industry standards, project requirements, or business goals.
Identify critical test scenarios that should be automated but currently aren't.
4. Identify Gaps
Compare the current state with the desired state.
Identify:
Test coverage gaps – Areas of the application not covered by automation.
Tool limitations – If existing tools are not supporting certain test cases.
Process inefficiencies – Bottlenecks in test execution, script maintenance, or reporting.
Skill gaps – If the team lacks expertise in automation tools or frameworks.
5. Analyze Root Causes
Determine why gaps exist (e.g., lack of resources, outdated test scripts, poor framework design).
Evaluate the impact of these gaps on test efficiency and product quality.
6. Create an Action Plan
Prioritize gaps based on risk and business impact.
Implement automation for critical missing test cases.
Optimize test scripts and framework for better coverage.
Upgrade tools or integrate additional solutions if needed.
Provide training to enhance team capabilities.
7. Monitor and Iterate
Track improvements over time and measure automation effectiveness.
Regularly update test automation to align with new features and changes.
Continuously refine the approach based on feedback and test outcomes.
